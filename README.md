# Mineral Ores

### ***This mod does not spawn ores into the world. They must be spawned using another mod, such as CoFHWorld, Geolysis, or Realistic Ore Veins.***

Adds a number of mixed-element mineral ore blocks and dusts to be generated and used at a modpack maker's discretion. Heavily based on GregTech 5. These blocks are useless without machines to grind them down and separate them.
